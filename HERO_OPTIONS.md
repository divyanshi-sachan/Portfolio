# Hero Section Options for Web Developer Portfolio

I've analyzed your current portfolio and created several modern, professional hero section alternatives that are more relevant to web development than the current space-themed astronaut design.

## Current Issues with Existing Hero

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Why it's great:**
- Immediately shows coding skills
- Professional and modern appearance

## Technical Notes

## Next Steps
